# Secure_Voting_System_Through_Face_Recognition

## Overview

Now-a-days in India there are two types of methods are used for voting. The first method is secret ballot paper, in which lots of paper are used and second method is EVM(Electronic Voting Machine) which is used since 2003 but both of those methods have some limitations. There is a necessity for a method for online voting that is more secure than the existing system. In our proposed system we introduce a secure way for online voting by using face recognition system and email verification at the time registration of a new voter which is used to authenticate a person. Authorized Voter also can able to cast their vote only once and the tallying of the votes will be done automatically, thus saving a huge time and enabling administrator to announce the result to announce the result within a very short period.
